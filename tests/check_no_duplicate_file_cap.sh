# check_no_duplicate_file_cap.sh — structural single-source-of-truth guard
# for the per-file parse-size cap.
#
# The 100MB per-file cap used to be expressed 7 times: 6x as the misused
# "CBM_PERCENT * CBM_SZ_1K * CBM_SZ_1K" literal (pass_calls.c, pass_definitions.c,
# pass_semantic.c, pass_usages.c, pass_k8s.c, pass_parallel.c) plus a twin enum
# PXC_MAX_FILE_BYTES_FACTOR in pass_lsp_cross.c. All 7 collapsed to the single
# named cbm_max_file_bytes() resolver (system_info.c) backed by
# CBM_DEFAULT_MAX_FILE_MB (constants.h). This script asserts the collapse
# STUCK: zero surviving duplicate-literal sites, and the new resolver present
# at all 7 former call sites.
#
# Reads COMMITTED source via `git show HEAD:<path>`, not the working tree —
# a mutation run rewrites the working tree during its sweep, which would
# make a working-tree grep abort as a tool-error mid-run. Reading HEAD keeps
# this check meaningful (and green) regardless of mutation-testing state.
#
# Also pins CBM_PERCENT's legitimate percentage/depth consumers
# (mem.c, vmem.c, cypher.c) as UNTOUCHED — the collapse must not repurpose
# the shared "100 percent" constant (AC row 5, characterization pin).
#
# Usage: bash tests/check_no_duplicate_file_cap.sh [<git-ref>]
#   <git-ref> defaults to HEAD.
# Exit 0 on success, non-zero on failure.
